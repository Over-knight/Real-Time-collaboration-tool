# Real-Time-collaboration-tool

1. Draft Core User Stories
Here’s a first pass. Please review and tweak or add any you think we’ll need:

Document Rooms

As a user, I can create a new collaboration room.

As a user, I can join an existing room via invite link.

Real-Time Text Editing

As a user in a room, I see live text edits from others.

As a user, I can type concurrently without conflicts.

Shared Whiteboard

As a user in a room, I can draw on a shared canvas.

As a user, I see others’ strokes in real time.

User Presence & Cursors

As a user, I see a list of who’s currently connected.

As a user, I see remote cursors or pointers with usernames.

Basic Permissions

As a room owner, I can invite others and assign “editor” or “viewer” roles.

As a viewer, I can observe but not edit or draw.

Does this align with your vision? Anything to add or remove?

2. Ultra-Lean Wireframe Sketch
Next, let’s outline our three core screens/components (we’ll flesh these out later in code):

Landing / Room List

“Create Room” button

“Join Room” input field (for link or ID)

Collaboration Workspace

Sidebar: Room info, online users, invite link/role settings

Main Panel Split:

Top half: Text editor

Bottom half: Canvas whiteboard

Cursor overlays in both areas

Auth Modal / Panel

Email / Password fields + Signup / Login toggle

Simple error messages



I'll be continuing soon just need time to work on my basics
